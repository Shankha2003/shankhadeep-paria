## 🎭 About This Beautiful Mess

Welcome to my portfolio! Where **pixels are perfect** but **semicolons are optional** (and frequently forgotten).

I'm a UI/UX designer who:
- ✅ Can make your product look like a million bucks
- ✅ Knows the difference between kerning and Kardashians
- ❌ Knows what "async/await" actually does
- ❌ Can center a div without Googling (okay, maybe I Googled it)

### 🎨 What I'm Actually Good At:
- **UI/UX Design** - Making things pretty AND functional (shocking, I know)
- **Digital Illustration** - Drawing cool stuff that makes people go "ooh"
- **Wireframing** - Boxes and lines are my love language
- **Prototyping** - Making things click before they actually work
- **User Research** - Asking people "why?" until they get annoyed

### 💻 What I Pretend to Be Good At:
- **React** - Copy-pasted from 17 different tutorials
- **TypeScript** - Red squiggly lines are just suggestions, right?
- **Framer Motion** - Making things go *whoosh* ✨
- **Git** - `git push --force` and pray 🙏
- **Tailwind CSS** - `className="flex items-center justify-center"` is my entire personality

## 🚀 The Tech Stack (aka My Google Search History)

```
Design Tools (Actually know these):
├── Figma ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
├── Adobe XD ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
├── Illustrator ⭐⭐⭐⭐
└── Photoshop ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Code Things (Stack Overflow is my co-pilot):
├── React ⭐⭐⭐ (I can make a button!)
├── TypeScript ⭐⭐ (I know it's JavaScript with anger issues)
├── Tailwind CSS ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Utility classes FTW)
├── Framer Motion ⭐⭐⭐ (animate={{ y: 20 }} = magic)
└── Git ⭐ (I've made peace with merge conflicts)
```

## 🛠️ Installation (Good Luck)

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio.git

# Install dependencies (this will take 5-10 business days)
npm install

# Run locally (fingers crossed 🤞)
npm run dev

# If it breaks, try:
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
# Sacrifice a rubber duck to the JavaScript gods
# Try again
```

## 🎯 My Development Process

1. **Design in Figma** - This is where I shine ✨
2. **Open VS Code** - Anxiety intensifies 😰
3. **Google "how to..."** - My best friend
4. **Copy code from tutorial** - Not stealing, it's "learning"
5. **Modify colors** - Now it's "original"
6. **Git commit** - "fix: stuff"
7. **Deploy** - Vercel handles the hard parts
8. **Cry** - Something always breaks
9. **Fix it** - Usually with more Googling
10. **Success!** - Until the next bug 🐛

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

> "Make it pretty first, make it work second, make it make sense third"
> 
> — Me, probably while breaking production

### My Design Principles:
1. **User-centered** - Unless the user wants ugly things
2. **Accessible** - Color contrast is not a suggestion
3. **Minimalist** - Or I'm just lazy, you decide
4. **Animated** - If it doesn't move, is it even design?
5. **Dark Mode** - Always. Forever. No exceptions.

## 🏆 Achievements Unlocked

- 🎨 Made a design system that people actually used
- 🐛 Fixed a bug without breaking 3 other things (once)
- ✨ Learned Framer Motion (still don't know how it works)
- 📚 Read "Graphic Design for Everyone" (now I'm everyone)
- 🎬 Cried watching "Grave of the Fireflies" (worth it)
- 🎵 Discovered Bengali indie rock is peak music
- 💻 Survived `npm install` without errors (rare achievement)
- 🧘 Made peace with CSS Grid vs Flexbox wars

---

## 📝 Todo List (aka Wishful Thinking)

- [ ] Learn what `Promise.all()` actually does
- [ ] Stop using `any` type in TypeScript
- [ ] Understand closures (been "learning" for 2 years)
- [ ] Write tests (HAHAHAHA)
- [ ] Fix that one bug I've been ignoring
- [ ] Update dependencies (scary)
- [ ] Read the entire React docs (instead of just searching)
- [ ] Center a div without Flexbox (impossible)

---

## 🎭 Fun Facts

- My commit messages are 90% "fix", 9% "update", 1% actual description
- I have 47 tabs open researching one error message
- My Figma files are organized. My code? Not so much.
- I named a variable `thingy` in production once
- I still Google "git commands" every single time
- My IDE theme changes more than my code does
- I've tried to `console.log()` a design file (it didn't work)
